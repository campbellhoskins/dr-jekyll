# PO Pro - Merchant Interview Questions

## Purpose

These questions are designed to deeply understand how merchants currently handle purchase ordering with suppliers. The goal is to validate our assumptions, uncover real pain points, and ensure we build an agent that matches actual merchant workflows.

**Interview Guidelines:**
- Let merchants tell stories - follow up with "Can you walk me through a recent example?"
- Listen for emotional language (frustration, anxiety, relief) - these indicate real pain points
- Don't lead with solutions - understand the problem first
- Note workarounds they've built - these reveal unmet needs
